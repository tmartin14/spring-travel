This application was taken from the Spring-Travel application and modified to be used as a demonstration application running on Cloud Foundry.  It will also build a war file that can easily be deployed into a tomcat server.  To build the app, from the /server directory use maven and execute "mvn clean install", the travel.war file will be built in the /target subdirectory.


Note:   At this time the 'server' is the only tested component.
